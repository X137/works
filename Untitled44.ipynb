    "# forerunner of some other calamity, ran about the town, beating their faces, and crying,\n",
    "# that this day had brought forth something that would prove fatal and destructive to all\n",
    "# Asia.\n",
    "# Just after Philip had taken Potidaea, he received these three messages at one time,\n",
    "# that Parmenio had overthrown the Illyrians in a great battle, that his race-horse had\n",
    "# won the course at the Olympic games, and that his wife had given birth to Alexander;\n",
    "# with which being naturally well pleased, as an addition to his satisfaction, he was\n",
    "# assured by the diviners that a son, whose birth was accompanied with three such\n",

    "# keeping the reins in his hand, and stroking him gently when he found him begin to grow\n",
    "# eager and fiery, he let fall his upper garment softly, and with one nimble leap securely\n",

    "# curbed him without either striking or spurring him. Presently, when he found him free\n",
    "# from all rebelliousness, and on]y impatient for the course, he let him go at full speed,\n",
    "# inciting him now with a commanding voice, and urging him also with his heel. Philip and\n",

    "# performed, they all burst out into acclamations of applause; and his father, shedding\n",

    "# have been particularly instructed in be laid open to all? For my part, I assure you, I had\n",
    "# rather excel others in the knowledge of what is excellent, than in the extent of my\n",
    "# power and dominion. Farewell.\" And Aristotle, soothing this passion for preeminence,\n",
    "# speaks, in his excuse for himself, of these doctrines, as in fact both published and not\n",
    "# published: as indeed, to say the truth, his books on metaphysics are written in a style\n",
    "# which makes them useless for ordinary teaching, and instructive only, in the way of\n",
    "# memoranda, for those who have been already conversant in that sort of learning.\n",
    "# Doubtless also it was to Aristotle, that he owed the inclination he had, not to the theory\n",
    "# only, but likewise to the practice of the art of medicine. For when any of his friends\n",
    "# were sick, he would often prescribe them their course of diet, and medicines proper to\n",
    "# their disease, as we may find in his epistles. He was naturally a great lover of all kinds\n",
    "# of learning and reading; and Onesicritus informs us, that he constantly laid Homer's\n",
    "# Iliads, according to the copy corrected by Aristotle, called the casket copy, with his\n",
    "# dagger under his pillow, declaring that he esteemed it a perfect portable treasure of all\n",
    "# military virtue and knowledge. When he was in the upper Asia, being destitute of other\n",
    "# books, he ordered Harpalus to send him some; who furnished him with Philistus's\n",
    "# History, a great many of the plays of Euripides, Sophocles, and Aeschylus, and some\n",
    "# dithyrambic odes, composed by Telestes and Philoxenus. For awhile he loved and\n",
    "# cherished Aristotle no less, as he was wont to say himself, than if he had been his\n",
    "# father, giving this reason for it, that as he had received life from the one, so the other\n",
    "# had taught him to live well. But afterwards, upon some mistrust of him, yet not so great\n",
    "# as to make him do him any hurt, his familiarity and friendly kindness to him abated so\n",
    "# much of its former force and affectionateness, as to make it evident he was alienated\n",
    "# from him. However, his violent thirst after and passion for learning, which were once\n",
    "# implanted, still grew up with him, and never decayed; as appears by his veneration of\n",

    "# of Olympias, a woman of a jealous and implacable temper, made wider, by exasperating\n",
    "# Alexander against his father. Among the rest, this accident contributed most to their\n",

    "# This so irritated Alexander, that throwing one of the cups at his head, \"You villain,\" said\n",
    "# he, \"what, am I then a bastard?\" Then Philip taking Attalus's part, rose up and would\n",
    "# have run his son through; but by good fortune for them both, either his over-hasty rage,\n",
    "# or the wine he had drunk, made his foot slip, so that he fell down on the floor. At which\n",
    "# Alexander reproachfully insulted over him: \"See there,\" said he, \"the man, who makes\n",
    "# preparations to pass out of Europe into Asia, overturned in passing from one seat to\n",
    "# another.\" After this debauch, he and his mother Olympias withdrew from Philip's\n",

    "# About this time, Demaratus the Corinthian, an old friend of the family, who had the\n",
    "# freedom to say anything among them without offense, coming to visit Philip, after the\n",

    "# Arrhidaeus, hoping by this alliance to secure his assistance upon occasion, Alexander's\n",

    "# preparing the way for settling the kingdom upon Arrhidaeus. In alarm at this, he\n",
    "# dispatched Thessalus, the tragic actor, into Caria, to dispose Pixodorus to slight\n",
    "# Arrhidaeus, both as illegitimate and a fool, and rather to accept of himself for his sonin-law. This proposition was much more agreeable to Pixodorus than the former. But\n",
    "# Philip, as soon as he was made acquainted with this transaction, went to his son's\n",
    "# apartment, taking with him Philotas, the son of Parmenio, one of Alexander's intimate\n",
    "# friends and companions, and there reproved him severely, and reproached him bitterly,\n",
    "# that he should be so degenerate, and unworthy of the power he was to leave him, as to\n",

    "# http://www.idph.net\n",

    "# To do which, for want of chalk, the soil being black, they laid out their lines with flour,\n",
    "# taking in a pretty large compass of ground in a semicircular figure, and drawing into the\n",

    "# restored his confidence again by telling him, it was a sign the city he was about to build\n",
    "# would not only abound in all things within itself, but also be the nurse and feeder of\n",
    "# many nations. He commanded the workmen to proceed, while he went to visit the\n",
    "# temple of Ammon.\n",
    "# This was a long and painful, and, in two respects, a dangerous journey; first, if they\n",

    "# secondly, if a violent south wind should rise upon them, while they were traveling\n",

    "# seconded him in his designs, made him resolute and firm in his opinions, and the\n",
    "# boldness of his temper raised a sort of passion in him for surmounting difficulties; as if it\n",
    "# were not enough to be always victorious in the field, unless places and seasons and\n",
    "# nature herself submitted to him. In this journey, the relief and assistance the gods\n",
    "# afforded him in his distresses, were more remarkable, and obtained greater belief than\n",
    "# the oracles he received afterwards, which, however, were valued and credited the\n",

    "# them from any fear of perishing by drought, and, allaying the extreme dryness of the\n",
    "# sand, which now became moist and firm to travel on, cleared and purified the air.\n",
    "# Besides this, when they were out of their way, and were wandering up and down,\n",
    "# because the marks which were wont to direct the guides were disordered and lost, they\n",
    "# were set right again by some ravens, which flew before them when on their march, and\n",

    "# that he made splendid offerings to Jupiter, and gave the priests very rich presents. This\n",
    "# is what most authors write concerning the oracles. But Alexander, in a letter to his\n",

    "# it went for current that the oracle had called him so.\n",
    "# Among the sayings of one Psammon, a philosopher, whom he heard in Egypt, he most\n",
    "# approved of this, that all men are governed by God, because in everything, that which is\n",

    "# even more like a philosopher, for he said, God was the common father of us all, but\n",
    "# more particularly of the best of us. To the barbarians he carried himself very haughtily,\n",

    "# The entrance into Persia was through a most difficult country, and was guarded by the\n",

    "# From hence designing to march against Darius, before he set out, he diverted himself\n",
    "# with his officers at an entertainment of drinking and other pastimes, and indulged so far\n",
